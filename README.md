Elegante Transportation
Cliente: Kareem
Case Study



<p>I contacted Kareem to see if he was interested in having a website design for his transportation service. Kareem transportation services operates through out the greater puget sound area. Kareem services transports customers from Seatac airport to any hotel, cruise ship, and tour or business destination yearly. Kareem has never had a website. The problem Kareem was having was a directed platform that has access to the world wide web which we all know is enormous and vast with future customers. Kareem is aware of how important a transportation website is as far as increasing their revenue and a network to connect with future and past customers. -Background

	The client needs online presents to attract more customers. So, I had explained to Kareem that you must have several different pages on your website. Examples: a visual page showing a 25 passenger bus, 10 passenger shuttle sprinter or van, and suv/luxury car to show different options that will cater to large groups or wedding couples. I shared with Kareem this step will help uplift his revenue. Additionally adding a contact page for customers to fill out for booking through email will give additional options. Also, adding a page for booking with hourly rates or trip amounts and payment options will help generate vast amounts of new customers who will then book with Elegante Transportation Service. -Issue/Problem</p>

	However, I will design the website to first be functional on a android or apple phone and adjust to a laptop or desktop which will be responsive and test the mobile readiness of the site by using google's mobile friendly test site. 
	
	Last of all, I explain to Kareem that mobile responsive is the best option and a website that is clear and uncluttered with soft colors is the best option as far as navigating online for enjoyment while booking. -Process/Actions/Decisions

	Kareems launched website currently receives emails and text messages thru various platforms like telegram, whatsapp, facebook. Kareem has booked clients for future summer cruises line trips months in advance and daily trips using the website's email contacts received through a contact form page. -Results

		Kareem of Elegante Transportation  states: “Launching this website has been huge for me in transportation services.”
